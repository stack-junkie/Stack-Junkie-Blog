# Create an AI‑Ready PRD Your LLM Can Actually Use

## Quick Summary

_Learn how to transform a conventional PRD into an AI‑ready workflow. You’ll chunk requirements, add context‑window guards, and embed success metrics so language models stay on track. TL;DR at the end._

I have created PRD after PRD to create MVP after MVP. One consistent pattern I've found is that AI tools are hit and miss if the requirements are not clear. I knew early that I needed to be more specific and provide as much content needed to get some coding done. And that works in a vacuum. But as my project gets bigger and the more different AI agents touch it, I'm left with a huge mess.
I've heard from a lot of sources that the more time spent in the planning phase, the easier time you'll have in the development phase. I've found this to be true. But it wasn't deep enough.

I set out to fully flesh out every requirement for a project prior to starting development. The usual tech stack, the overall goal and features required of course. But then to take the features list and break it down until I can't anymore.

Breakdown Hierarchy:
Feature - High-level functionality
File - Where code lives
Function - What code does
Variable - Data that functions use
Code - Actual implementation
Implementation Logic - Step-by-step flow

Everything down to the entities and dtheir elements and relationships to others, and all the logic in between. So every variable name is defined with its purpose. Once that is all defined, tests can be developed to validate the requirements of each bit of code file and feature. Which is great to go about creating projects from a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach.

Following that, I wanted to come up with a plan for how I will break up the work between AI agents. And that plan is to pre plan the prompts for each AI agent. I first heard about this concept on YouTube - creating Project Requirements Prompts (PRP) to break down PRDs into AI agent tasks. Where they would create a PRD and then break it down into prompts for each AI agent. The difference between that and what I'm calling a Pre-Development Planning Workflow (PDPW). A plan that does the job of a PRD, and a PRP, but goes deeper than anything else I've seen so far.

I did this with Claude Sonnet 4 with thinking and Canvas with awesome results.

The full workflow I developed takes potentially hours upfront but saves weeks of debugging and rework.

## Why Bother? The PRD vs. the Context Window

Even a “small” 15‑page PRD is 10× larger than the average GPT‑4 context window. That means your beautifully crafted spec becomes **white noise** to the model. An AI‑ready PRD is intentionally concise, strongly typed, and broken into atomic units so you can feed the right chunk at the right time.

Key pain points solved:

- **Token overload → fail‑to‑compile code**
- **Ambiguous user stories → hallucinated features**
- **Missing non‑functional guardrails → security & perf regressions**

## The AI‑Ready PRD Workflow (Step‑by‑Step)

### 1. Clarify the Product Goal

Write one sentence that captures the value proposition and target user. Everything else ladders up to this.

### 2. Map Key Personas & Jobs‑to‑Be‑Done

List each persona, their primary JTBD, and a single success metric that proves you solved it.

### 3. Draft User Stories

Follow the classic “As a *\<persona>*, I want *\<action>* so that *\<outcome>*.” Keep them task‑level, not screen‑level.

### 4. Slice Stories into Features

Convert each story into tangible features. One story → one feature whenever possible.

### 5. Prioritize with MoSCoW

Mark each feature as Must, Should, Could, or Won’t. Must == MVP; Won’t == parking lot.

### 6. Add Non‑Functional Minimums

Set baseline SLAs: **HTTPS, 300 ms median response, basic auth, error logging**.

### 7. Define Success Metrics

For every Must feature, add a quantifiable metric: e.g., _“Habit check‑in success ≥ 95 %”_.

### 8. Annotate Context Boundaries

Wrap each major section in a Markdown code fence with a clear label so you can programmatically pull it into prompts.

### 9. Chunk & Ship to the LLM

Feed the model **one fenced section at a time**. Include the product goal and success metric in every prompt to keep it grounded.

## Example: Snippet from an AI‑Ready PRD

```md
<!-- 👇 CONTEXT: PRODUCT GOAL -->

The Habit Tracker helps busy professionals build daily routines with micro‑feedback.

<!-- 👇 CONTEXT: USER STORY M01 -->

As a user, I want to create a habit with a name and frequency so I can track progress.

<!-- 👇 CONTEXT: FEATURE F01 (Must) -->

- Endpoint: POST /habits
- Validation: name ≤ 40 chars, frequency ∈ {daily, weekly}
- Success metric: 95 % of POSTs return 201

<!-- 👇 CONTEXT: NON‑FUNCTIONAL BASELINE -->

- Response ≤ 300 ms (p95)
- All endpoints require JWT auth over HTTPS
```

Use these fences (`<!-- CONTEXT: ... -->`) as regex anchors when generating prompts.

## Reusable Markdown Template

```md
# Product Goal

<One sentence value prop>

## Personas & JTBD

| Persona | Job‑to‑Be‑Done | Success Metric |
| ------- | -------------- | -------------- |
|         |                |                |

## User Stories

<As a…, I want…, so that…>

## Feature List (MoSCoW)

| ID  | Feature | Priority |
| --- | ------- | -------- |
| F01 |         | Must     |

## Non‑Functional Requirements

- Security: <min baseline>
- Performance: <p95 latency>

## Success Metrics

| Feature | Metric | Target |
| ------- | ------ | ------ |

## Risks & Mitigations

## Out‑of‑Scope / Won’t Have

## Common Pitfalls and Fixes

| Pitfall                                   | Why it hurts                                  | Simple Fix                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Treating the PRD like a hand‑off document | AI needs incremental context, not a data dump | Deliver it section‑by‑section via prompts      |
| **Mixing user stories and tech tasks**    | Confuses priority & ownership                 | Separate functional vs. implementation details |
| **Skipping Won’t‑Have items**             | Features creep back in                        | Explicitly list Won’ts & link engineers back   |
| **No success metrics**                    | Can’t tell if “done”                          | Attach one measurable KPI to every Must        |
| **Over‑relying on AI without review**     | Silent errors pile up                         | Daily human code reviews                       |

## Conclusion

A well‑chunked, metric‑driven PRD turns an LLM from an unpredictable intern into a reliable junior engineer. Start small, enforce context limits, and iterate fast.

**_Next steps_**

1. Copy the template above.
2. Fill in Goal → Won’t‑Haves.
3. Hand the _Goal_ and first _Feature_ section to your AI pair‑programmer.
4. Review output, then feed the next chunk.

## FAQ

1. **How short should each chunk be?** Aim for ≤ 1,000 tokens so you can prepend the system prompt and still fit.
2. **Do I include diagrams?** Yes—export as mermaid or PlantUML and embed the source code so the model can consume it textually.
3. **Where do success metrics live?** Inline with each Must feature; dashboards can come later.
4. **What if the model hallucinates requirements?** Reject the diff, restate the product goal, and re‑prompt with the correct chunk.
5. **When do I graduate features from Won’t to Could?** Only after the MVP meets its success metric and user feedback demands expansion.

## TL;DR

Break your PRD into atomic, labeled chunks. Prioritize with MoSCoW, attach metrics, and feed one chunk at a time to the LLM. Guardrails + metrics = predictable AI output.
